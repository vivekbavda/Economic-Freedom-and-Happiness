# Government Spending

The government spending component captures the burden imposed by government expenditures, which includes consumption by the state and all transfer payments related to various entitlement programs.

No attempt has been made to identify an optimal level of government spending. The ideal level will vary from country to country, depending on factors that range from culture to geography to level of economic development. At some point, however, government spending becomes an unavoidable burden as growth in the size and scope of the public sector leads inevitably to misallocation of resources and loss of economic efficiency. Volumes of research have shown that excessive government spending that causes chronic budget deficits and the accumulation of public debt is one of the most serious drags on economic dynamism.

The Index methodology treats zero government spending as the benchmark. As a result, underdeveloped countries, particularly those with little government capacity, may receive artificially high scores. However, such governments, which can provide few if any public goods, are likely to receive low scores on some of the other components of economic freedom (such as property rights, financial freedom, and investment freedom) that measure aspects of government effectiveness.

Government spending has a major impact on economic freedom, but it is just one of many important components. The scale for scoring government spending is nonlinear, which means that government spending that is close to zero is lightly penalized, while government spending that exceeds 30 percent of GDP leads to much worse scores in a quadratic fashion (for example, doubling spending yields four times less freedom). Only extraordinarily high levels of government spending (for example, more than 58 percent of GDP) receive a score of zero.

The equation used to compute a country’s government spending score is:
GEi = 100–α (Expendituresi )2
<p align="center">
    GE<sub>i</sub> = 100–α(Expenditures<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p>

where **GE<sub>i</sub>** represents the government expenditure score in country ***i***; **Expenditures<sub>i</sub>** represents the average total government spending at all levels as a percentage of GDP for the most recent three years; and **α** is a coefficient to control for variation among scores (set at 0.03). The minimum component score is zero.1 

In most cases, the *Index* uses general government expenditure data that include all levels of government such as federal, state, and local. In cases where data on general government spending are not available, data on central government expenditures are used instead.

For a number of countries, particularly developing countries, statistics related to government spending as a percentage of GDP are subject to frequent revisions by such data sources as the IMF.
