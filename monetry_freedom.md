# Monetary Freedom

Monetary freedom combines a measure of inflation with an assessment of various government activities that distort prices. Price stability without microeconomic intervention is the ideal state for the free market. 

The score for the monetary freedom component is based on two sub-factors:

- The weighted average rate of inflation for the most recent three years and
- A qualitative judgement about the extent of government manipulation of prices through direct controls or subsidies. 

The weighted average rate of inflation for the most recent three years serves as the primary input into an equation that generates the base score for monetary freedom. The extent of price controls is then assessed as a penalty deduction of up to 20 points from the base score. The two equations used to convert rates of inflation into the final monetary freedom score are:
Weighted Avg. Inflationi = θ1 Inflationit + θ2 Inflationit–1 + θ3 Inflationit–2
<p align="center">
    Weighted Avg. Inflation<sub>i</sub> = θ<sub>1</sub>Inflation<sub>it</sub> + θ<sub>2</sub>Inflation<sub>it-1</sub> + θ<sub>3</sub>Inflation<sub>it-2</sub><br>s
Monetary Freedom<sub>i</sub> = 100 – α √Weighted Avg. Inflation<sub>i</sub> – PC penalty<sub>i</sub></p>

where θ<sub>1</sub> through θ<sub>3</sub> (thetas 1–3) represent three numbers that sum to 1 and are exponentially smaller in sequence (in this case, values of 0.665, 0.245, and 0.090, respectively); Inflation<sub>it</sub> is the absolute value of the annual rate of inflation in country *i* during year *t* as measured by the Consumer Price Index; α represents a coefficient that stabilizes the variance of scores; and the price control (PC) penalty is an assigned value of 0–20 penalty points based on the extent of price controls.

The convex (square root) functional form was chosen to create separation among countries with low rates of inflation. A concave functional form would essentially treat all hyperinflations as equally bad, whether they were 100 percent price increases annually or 100,000 percent, whereas the square root provides much more gradation. The α coefficient is set to equal 6.333, which converts a 10 percent inflation rate into a monetary freedom score of 80.0 and a 2 percent inflation rate into a score of 91.0.
