# Government Integrity

Corruption erodes economic freedom by introducing insecurity and coercion into economic
relations. Of greatest concern is the systemic corruption of government institutions and decision making by such practices as bribery, extortion, nepotism, cronyism, patronage, embezzlement,
and graft. The lack of government integrity caused by such practices reduces public trust and
economic vitality by increasing the costs of economic activity.

The score for this component is derived by averaging scores for the following five sub-factors,
all of which are weighted equally:

- Irregular payments and bribes,
- Transparency of government policymaking,
- Absence of corruption,
- Perceptions of corruption, and
- Governmental and civil service transparency.


Each of these sub-factors is derived from numerical data sets that are normalized for comparative purposes using the following equation:

<p align="center">
    Sub-factor Score<sub>i</sub> = 100 x (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>i</sub> ) / (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>Min</sub>)</p>

where **Sub-factor<sub>i</sub>** represents the original data for country ***i***, **Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>** and **Sub-factor<sub>Min</sub>** represent the upper and lower bounds for the corresponding data set, and **Sub-factor Score <sub>i</sub>** represents the computed sub-factor score for country ***i***.

For a few countries, comparable data were not available for every sub-factor. In each of these cases, a score was computed for the missing sub-factor based on the relative percentile ranking of that country on the other sub-factors.
