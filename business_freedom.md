# Business Freedom

The business freedom component measures the extent to which the regulatory and infrastructure environments constrain the efficient operation of businesses. The quantitative score is derived from an array of factors that affect the ease of starting, operating, and closing a business.

The business freedom score for each country is a number between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating the freest business environment. The score is based on 13 sub-factors, all of which are weighted equally, using data from the *World Bank’s Doing Business* report:

- Starting a business—procedures (number);
- Starting a business—time (days);
- Starting a business—cost (% of income per capita);
- Starting a business—minimum capital (% of income per capita);
- Obtaining a license—procedures (number);
- Obtaining a license—time (days);
- Obtaining a license—cost (% of income per capita);
- Closing a business—time (years);
- Closing a business—cost (% of estate);
- Closing a business—recovery rate (cents on the dollar);
- Getting electricity—procedures (number);
- Getting electricity—time (days); and
- Getting electricity—cost (% of income per capita)

Each of these sub-factors is converted to a scale of 0 to 100, after which the average of the converted values is computed. The result represents the country’s business freedom score in comparison to the business freedom scores of other countries.

Each sub-factor is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 using the following equation:

<p align="center">
    Sub-factor Score<sub>i</sub> = 50 x (Sub-factor<sub>average</sub> / Sub-factor<sub>i</sub> )</p>

which is based on the ratio of the country data for each sub-factor relative to the world average, multiplied by 50. For example, on average worldwide, it takes 19.7 days to start a business. The Philippines’ 33 days to start a business is a sub-factor value that is worse than the average, resulting in a ratio of 0.60. That ratio multiplied by 50 equals the final sub-factor score of 29.8.

For the five countries that are not covered by the *World Bank’s Doing Business* report, business freedom is scored by analyzing business regulations based on qualitative information from reliable and internationally recognized sources.
