# Labor Freedom

The labor freedom component is a quantitative measure that considers various aspects of the legal and regulatory framework of a country’s labor market, including regulations concerning minimum wages, laws inhibiting layoffs, severance requirements, and measurable regulatory restraints on hiring and hours worked, plus the labor force participation rate as an indicative measure of employment opportunities in the labor market.

Seven quantitative sub-factors are equally weighted, with each sub-factor counted as one-seventh of the labor freedom component:

- Ratio of minimum wage to the average value added per worker,
- Hindrance to hiring additional workers,
- Rigidity of hours,
- Difficulty of firing redundant employees,
- Legally mandated notice period,
- Mandatory severance pay, and
- Labor force participation rate.

In constructing the labor freedom score, each of the seven sub-factors is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 based on the following equation:

    Sub-factor Score<sub>i</sub> = 50 x (Sub-factor<sub>average</sub> / Sub-factor<sub>i</sub>)</p>

where country *i* data are calculated relative to the world average and then multiplied by 50. The seven sub-factor scores are then averaged for each country, yielding a labor freedom score in comparison to other countries.

The simple average of the converted values for the seven sub-factors is computed to obtain the country’s overall labor freedom score.

For the five countries that are not covered by the World Bank’s Doing Business report,7 the labor freedom component is scored by looking at labor market flexibility based on qualitative information from other reliable and internationally recognized sources.

The *Index* relies on the following sources for data on labor freedom, in order of priority: World Bank, Doing Business; International Labour Organization, statistics and databases; World Bank, World Development Indicators; Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Commerce; U.S. Department of Commerce, Country Commercial Guide; and ofcial government publications of each country
