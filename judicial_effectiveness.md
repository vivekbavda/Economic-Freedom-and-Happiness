# Judicial Effectiveness

Well-functioning legal frameworks are essential for protecting the rights of all citizens against unlawful acts by others, including governments and powerful private parties. Judicial effectiveness requires efficient and fair judicial systems to ensure that laws are fully respected and appropriate legal actions are taken against violations.

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo:

- Judicial independence,
- Quality of the judicial process, and
- Favoritism in obtaining judicial decisions

Each of these sub-factors is derived from numerical data sets that are normalized for comparative purposes using the following equation:

<p align="center">
    Sub-factor Score<sub>i</sub> = 100 x (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>i</sub> ) / (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>Min</sub>)</p>


where **Sub-factor<sub>i</sub>** represents the original data for country ***i***, **Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>** and **Sub-factor<sub>Min</sub>** represent the upper and lower bounds for the corresponding data set, and **Sub-factor Score <sub>i</sub>** represents the computed sub-factor score for country ***i***.

For a few countries, comparable data were not available for every sub-factor. In each of these cases, a score was computed for the missing sub-factor based on the relative percentile ranking of that country on the other sub-factors.
