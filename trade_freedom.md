# Trade Freedom

Trade freedom is a composite measure of the extent of tariff and nontariff barriers that affect imports and exports of goods and services. The trade freedom score is based on two inputs:

- The trade-weighted average tariff rate and
- A qualitative evaluation of nontariff barriers (NTBs).

Different imports entering a country can (and often do) face different tariffs. The weighted average tariff uses weights for each tarif based on the share of imports for each good. Weighted average tariffs are a purely quantitative measure and account for the calculation of the base trade freedom score using the following equation:

<p align="center">
    TradeFreedom<sub>i</sub> = 100(Tariff<sub>max</sub>-Tariff<sub>i</sub> ) / (Tariff<sub>max</sub>-Tariff<sub>Min</sub>)-NTB<sub>i</sub></p>

where **Trade Freedom<sub>i</sub>** represents the trade freedom in country *i*; **Tariff<sub>max</sub>** and **Tariff<sub>min</sub>** represent the upper and lower bounds for tariff rates (%); and Tariff<sub>i</sub> represents the weighted average tariff rate (%) in country *i*. The minimum tarif is naturally zero percent, and the upper bound was set at 50 percent.

We determine the extent of NTBs in a country’s trade policy regime using both qualitative and quantitative information. Restrictive rules that hinder trade vary widely, and their overlapping and shifting nature makes their complexity difficult to gauge. The types of NTBs considered in our scoring include:

- **Quantity restrictions**—import quotas; export limitations; voluntary export restraints; import–export embargoes and bans; countertrade; etc.
- **Regulatory restrictions**—licensing; domestic content and mixing requirements; sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPSs); safety and industrial standards regulations; packaging, labeling, and trademark regulations; advertising and media regulations.
- **Customs restrictions**—advance deposit requirements; customs valuation procedures; customs classification procedures; customs clearance procedures.
- **Direct government intervention**—subsidies and other aid; government industrial policies; government-financed research and other technology policies; competition policies; government procurement policies; state trading, government monopolies, and exclusive franchises.

In addition, where possible, we consider and report the number of nontariff measures in force as calculated by the World Trade Organization (WTO).

As an example, Togo received a trade freedom score of 65.4. By itself, Togo’s trade-weighted average tariff of 12.3 percent would have yielded a score of 75.4, but the evaluation of NTBs in Togo resulted in a 10-point deduction from that score. 

Gathering tarif statistics to make a consistent cross-country comparison is a challenging task. Unlike data on inflation, for instance, some countries do not report their weighted average tarif rate or simple average tariff rate every year.

To preserve consistency in grading the trade freedom component, the Index uses the most recently reported most favored nation (MFN) trade-weighted average tariff rate for a country from our primary source.

The most comprehensive and consistent information on MFN trade-weighted average tariff rates is published by the WTO. When the MFN trade-weighted average applied tariff rate is not available, the Index uses the country’s simple average of MFN tariff rates; when the country’s simple average MFN tariff rate is not available, the weighted average or the simple average of applied tariff rates is used. In the very few cases where tarif rates are not available from the WTO or the World Bank, data on international trade taxes or an estimated effective tariff rate are used instead.
