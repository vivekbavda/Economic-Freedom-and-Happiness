The more effective the legal protection of property is, the higher a country’s score will be. Similarly, the greater the chances of government expropriation of property are, the lower a country’s score will be.

The score for this component is derived by averaging scores for the following five sub-factors, all of which are weighted equally:

- Physical property rights, 
- Intellectual property rights, 
- Strength of investor protection, 
- Risk of expropriation, and 
- Quality of land administration.

Each of these sub-factors is derived from numerical data sets that are normalized for comparative purposes using the following equation:

<p align="center">
    Sub-factor Score<sub>i</sub> = 100 x (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>i</sub> ) / (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>Min</sub>)</p>

where **Sub-factor<sub>i</sub>** represents the original data for country ***i***, **Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>** and **Sub-factor<sub>Min</sub>** represent the upper and lower bounds for the corresponding data set, and **Sub-factor Score <sub>i</sub>** represents the computed sub-factor score for country ***i***.

For a few countries, comparable data were not available for every sub-factor. In each of these cases, a score was computed for the missing sub-factor based on the relative percentile ranking of that country on the other sub-factors.
