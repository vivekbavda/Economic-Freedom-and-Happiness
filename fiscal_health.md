# Fiscal Health

Widening deficits and a growing debt burden, both of which are caused by poor government budget management, lead to the erosion of a country’s overall fiscal health. Deteriorating fiscal health, in turn, is associated with macroeconomic instability and economic uncertainty.

Debt is an accumulation of budget deficits over time. In theory, debt financing of public spending could make a positive contribution to productive investment and ultimately to economic growth. However, mounting public debt driven by persistent budget deficits, particularly spending that merely boosts government consumption or transfer payments, often undermines overall productivity growth and leads ultimately to economic stagnation rather than growth.

The score for the fiscal health component is based on two sub-factors, which are weighted as follows in calculating the overall component score:

- Average deficits as a percentage of GDP for the most recent three years (80 percent of score) and
- Debt as a percentage of GDP (20 percent of score)

Each of these sub-factors is derived from numerical data sets that are normalized for comparative purposes using the following equation:

<p align="center">
    Sub-factor Score<sub>i</sub> = 100 x (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>i</sub> ) / (Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>-factor<sub>Min</sub>)</p>

where **Sub-factor<sub>i</sub>** represents the original data for country ***i***, **Sub-factor<sub>Max</sub>** and **Sub-factor<sub>Min</sub>** represent the upper and lower bounds for the corresponding data set, and **Sub-factor Score <sub>i</sub>** represents the computed sub-factor score for country ***i***.

For a few countries, comparable data were not available for every sub-factor. In each of these cases, a score was computed for the missing sub-factor based on the relative percentile ranking of that country on the other sub-factors.
