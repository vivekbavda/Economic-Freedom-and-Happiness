# Tax Burden

Tax burden is a composite measure that reflects marginal tax rates on both personal and corporate income and the overall level of taxation (including direct and indirect taxes imposed by all levels of government) as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The component score is derived from three quantitative sub-factors:

The score for the judicial effectiveness component is derived by averaging scores for the following three sub-factors, all of which are weighted equally:

- The top marginal tax rate on individual income,
- The top marginal tax rate on corporate income, and
- The total tax burden as a percentage of GDP.

Each of these numerical variables is weighted equally as one-third of the component score. This equal weighting allows a country to achieve a score as high as 67 based on two of the factors even if it receives a score of 0 on the third.

Tax burden scores are calculated with a quadratic cost function to reflect the diminishing revenue returns from very high rates of taxation. The data for each sub-factor are converted to a 100-point scale using the following equation:
Tax Burdenij = 100 – α (Factorij)2
<p align="center">
    Tax Burden<sub>ij</sub> = 100 – α (Factor<sub>ij</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p>

where **Tax Burden<sub>ij</sub>** represents the tax burden in country ***i*** for factor ***j***; **Factor<sub>j</sub>** represents the value (a percentage expressed on a scale of 0 to 100) in country ***i*** for factor ***j***; and **α** is a coefficient set equal to 0.03. The minimum score for each sub-factor is zero, which is not represented in the printed equation but was used because it means that no single high tax burden will make the other two sub-factors irrelevant.

As an example, in the 2021 Index, Georgia has a top marginal tax rate of 20.0 percent on individual income and 15.0 percent on corporate income, which yields a score of 88.0 for the individual side and 93.3 on the corporate side. Georgia’s overall tax burden as a portion of GDP is 21.7 percent, yielding a score of 85.9 for that factor. When the three factors are averaged together, Georgia’s overall tax burden score becomes 89.1.
